# Custom LaTeX template for theses

**Custom** [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template â€“ created for my thesis at the [Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin](https://www.beuth-hochschule.de/en/).

> **This is not an official template of the Beuth University!**

## How to Typeset (build & preview LaTeX files)

- install LaTeX and an editor/previewer (comes often bundled) from e.g. the [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
- clone this repo
- open the `main.tex` file with your installed LaTeX editor/previewer
- run the `Typeset` action or the equivalent in your editor/previewer
- (optionally run the `Typeset` action several times if errors/warnings appear in the console on the first pass)
- open the preview area of your editor/previewer or open the `main.pdf` file to see the results

## How to navigate

- `main.tex` is your root entry point of your document
- `main.pdf` is always the latest _generated_ PDF file of your typesetted document
- `1_frontmatter/` includes everything that comes _before_ your actual content
- `2_bodymatter/` includes everything that is your custom content
- `3_backmatter/` includes everything that comes _after_ your actual content
- `images/` is where all images belong (I recommend `.eps` files for graphics and diagrams etc.)
- `libraries/` is where the bibliography and glossary store their entries
- `packages.tex` is a list of all added plugins

### Disclaimer

- _This template still has bugs. Be aware._  
Like this workaround in the `main.tex` file, you need to know about:

```tex
% restore roman page numbering for secondary pages
\pagenumbering{roman}
\setcounter{page}{42} % WORKAROUND: update number manually depending on the glossary length!
```

- I have only tested it on UNIX-based operating systems and in a _very small_ selection of editors.

- It is normal that LaTeX generates a lot of additional files. They should be ignored by Git.

- Please ask your educational institution if this template meets their standards before using it.
